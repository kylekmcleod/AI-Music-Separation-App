# AI-Powered Music Separator
Welcome to my music splitter project! This application enables you to separate music into individual streams such as vocals, bass, percussion, and more. With this tool, you can rebalance the individual volumes of these elements, providing you with the simplest way to obtain multitracks from any song.

## Features
- **AI-Driven Stem Separation**: Utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to dissect audio into individual components with extreme accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for uploading audio files and selecting elements to isolate.
- **Creative Control**: Extracted components grant you the creative freedom to modify, remix, and share your creations.
- **Support for Various Audio Formats**: Works seamlessly with all types of audio files, including WAV files.
- **Versatile Applications**: Ideal for music producers, DJs, karaoke enthusiasts, podcasters, and content creators.


## How It Works
1. **Upload Your Audio File**: Choose the song you want to separate.
2. **AI Processing**: The AI processes the audio, which usually takes about 1 minute.
3. **Select Elements to Isolate**: Pick the components you wish to isolate (vocals, bass, drums, etc.).
4. **Download and Edit**: Once the separation is complete, download the individual stems and adjust their volumes or remix them as desired.
